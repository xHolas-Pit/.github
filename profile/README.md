There are numerous defi strategies in the world of interoperable blockchains, but implementing on-chain executions in solidity is difficult. As defi grows, non-technical traders should have the tools to deploy custom strategies without writing code. 
So we built xHolas, a plug-and-play defi strategy builder, to provide a no-code tool for executing cross-chain defi strategies. 

Feel free to check out the current [deployment](xholas.vercel.app) and our presentation [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V0T_K-vqmEk2MqcLvSJt26at3LBLFKhMuJ7ZT80KZeU/edit?usp=sharing)
